/*
 * 1. You are given an array of n integers. 2. You have to divide these n
 * integers into 2 subsets such that the difference of sum of two subsets is as
 * minimum as possible. 3. If n is even, both set will contain exactly n/2
 * elements. If is odd, one set will contain (n-1)/2 and other set will contain
 * (n+1)/2 elements. 3. If it is not possible to divide, then print "-1".
